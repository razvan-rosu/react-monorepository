Ever thought of decoupling your components from your project?
Maybe you want to keep track of their evolution, or maybe to share them between projects.
If so, you're in the right place as this project is a boilerplate for a ReactJS component library.

Being a mono-repository, each component is versioned (in each component folder you'll find a `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` file).
With some additional tooling, StorybookJS, we can preview each component and in every state.

Since you will want to develop your own components, TailwindCSS will come in hand to style your components with minimum impact on the file size.
For code quality, the following tools are available: eslint, prettier and editorconfig.

### Install the project:
> npm i

### Run the project:
> npm run storybook
